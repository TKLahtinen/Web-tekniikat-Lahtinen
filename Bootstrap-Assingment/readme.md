# Bootstrap Assigmment

This folder contains bootstrap assignment. I have also made other assignments linked to this starting with UI design. All asssignments follows in order.

# UI Design

I made a wireframe with Figma for EPlane and it contains a general style and colorpalette for each page. Site follows this plan with minor differences. Pictures and contents of containers and other components has been added directly to the page.

Font has also been added directly to page.

# Bootstrap

As required I made whole page using bootstrap. It was educational journey and I learned alot how to use bootstrap.

Website contains three pages which differ in layout but still has consistency. Website also have different components including the required ones (button, accordion and navbar).

List of components which I used in sites(Also included in html files as comments):
Navbar - general: Navbar works same way in all pages. Only problem there is that in home page it wont come top of everything in mobile mode and I dont know the reason.

Containers, rows and columns - general: I used these to make the site responsive and clean.

Accordion - Home: There are 3 accordions in home page they are separated for styling.

Carousel - Home: In desktop mode there is carousel at the top which hides when going mobile.

Buttons - Home, Order: There are buttons which are made with bootstrap button components. Styles has been changed to meet my requirments.

Form - Order: In order form there is used bootstrap form components with dropdown menus. Order form also use javascript to refresh the price. Documentation how the script works is included to code.js file.

Other: Every container and picture are rounded with bootstrap class. Images also has width set with bootstrap.
